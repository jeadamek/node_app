## ✏️ About

This project was developed on Stage 8 in the Explorer course at the [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course assignments click [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat). 


In this project, the challenge was to build an API using Node.js, this is part of a larger application that will be developed in the next two stages of the course.

A database for movie ratings was developed. Tools such as SQLite, Beekeeper Studio, and Query Builder Knex.js were used for this.

I could practice and study:

- API REST built in NodeJS e ExpressJS;
- SQLite database to save the data;
- Tool Beekeeper Studio;
- Query Builder with Knex.js;
- PM2 Advanced process manager for production Node.js applications;
- JWT with jsonwebtoken;
- Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form data;
- Promises with Async Await;
- Protect sensitive data;
- Classes and events;
- Inheritance and Polymorphism;
- Route mapping;
- Insomnia to register routes and check status codes;
- Asynchronous and promises;
- Object orientation;
- Callbacks Functions;
- ES6 Modules;


The database diagram can be seen in the image below:<br/>

Clone the project and access the project's folder:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jeadamek/rocketMovies_backend.git
$ cd rocketMovies_backend
```

### Install server and run the project

```bash
$ cd rocket-movies-api
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
PORT Server localhost:3333
